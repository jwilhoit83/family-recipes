<ul class='list-disc ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>½ cup (113g) unsalted butter cut into 6-8 slices</li>
    <li>8 ounces (227g) semi-sweet chocolate coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>¾ cup (150g) firmly packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3 large eggs (room temperature preferred)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>¾ cup (90g) all-purpose flour be sure to measure properly</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h3 class='text-xl py-2'>Marscapone Layer</h3>
<ul class='list-disc ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>8 ounces (226g) mascarpone cheese softened to room temperature</li>
    <li>¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg (room temperature preferred)</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h3 class='text-xl py-2'>Ladyfinger Layer</h3>
<ul class='list-disc ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>12 Ladyfingers</li>
    <li>½ cup strong brewed coffee</li>    
</ul>
<h2 class='text-2xl py-4'>Instructions</h2>
<h3 class='text-xl py-2'>Brownie Layer</h3>
<ol class='list-decimal ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF (177ºC). Line an 8" square baking pan with foil and spray with nonstick spray. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and chopped chocolate, stirring frequently until completely smooth. Allow mixture to cool while you move onto the mascarpone layer.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class='text-xl py-2'>Marscapone Layer</h3>
<ol class='list-decimal ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>In a medium size bowl with a handheld mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the softened mascarpone cheese, sugar, egg, and salt until completely smooth.</li>
    <li>Set aside.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class='text-xl py-2'>Finish Brownie Layer</h3>
<ol class='list-decimal ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>Whisk sugar into cooled chocolate mixture until combined. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking after each addition until smooth. Whisk in the vanilla. Add the flour and salt and stir gently until completely combined.</li>
    <li>Reserve ⅓ cup of the batter and set aside.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class='text-xl py-2'>Assembly</h3>
<ol class='list-decimal ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>Pour the remaining brownie batter into the prepared pan.</li>
    <li>Press each individual Ladyfinger cookie upside down into the brownie batter. See post narrative for a visual.</li>
    <li>Once you have placed all 12 Ladyfinger cookies, pour the brewed coffee evenly over the ladyfingers.</li>
    <li>Working quickly because the Ladyfingers will become quite soft, pour the mascarpone layer on top of the Ladyfingers and, using a spatula, carefully spread the layer and cover all exposed cookies.</li>
    <li>Drop spoonfuls of the reserved brownie batter on top of the mascarpone cheese layer and use a knife to create swirls by dragging it through the batter.</li>
    <li>Bake brownies for 38-42 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean. Allow brownies to cool completely before cutting into squares. Store brownies covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 2 months.</li>
