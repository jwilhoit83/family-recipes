# Pesto Sauce

## Ingredients

* 30 g pine nuts, lightly toasted + cooled
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1 garlic clove, roughly chopped
* 30 g basil leaves, washed + dried 
* 20 grams Parmesan Reggiano, finely grated 
* 10 grams Pecorino Romano, finely grated
* 80 ml extra virgin olive oil

## Instructions

1. Add the garlic, salt, and pine nuts to the mortar. Using the pestle, muddle the ingredients in a circular motion until it becomes a paste.
2. Add the basil leaves to the mortar. Using the pestle, pound the leaves into the garlic paste. If the leaves are taking a while to break down, add a splash of olive oil.
3. Once the basil has broken down, add the cheese. Add a small amount of oil at a time, pounding in between to combine the pesto. Tip: If your pesto begins to break, add another sprinkling of grated cheese. 
4. Alternatively, combine the garlic, salt, and pine nuts in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the nuts are finely chopped. Add the basil leaves and the cheeses. While the machine is running, stream in the olive oil. 
5. Use immediately or store the pesto in an airtight container. Before closing the lid, add a thin layer of olive oil on top of the pesto to prevent discoloring. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.
