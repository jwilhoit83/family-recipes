<h2 class='text-2xl py-4'>Ingredients</h2>
<ul class='list-disc ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>30 g pine nuts, lightly toasted + cooled</li>
    <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>30 g basil leaves, washed + dried </li>
    <li>20 grams Parmesan Reggiano, finely grated </li>
    <li>10 grams Pecorino Romano, finely grated</li>
    <li>80 ml extra virgin olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h2 class='text-2xl py-4'>Instructions</h2>
<ol class='list-decimal ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>Add the garlic, salt, and pine nuts to the mortar. Using the pestle, muddle the ingredients in a circular motion until it becomes a paste.</li>
    <li>Add the basil leaves to the mortar. Using the pestle, pound the leaves into the garlic paste. If the leaves are taking a while to break down, add a splash of olive oil.</li>
    <li>Once the basil has broken down, add the cheese. Add a small amount of oil at a time, pounding in between to combine the pesto. Tip: If your pesto begins to break, add another sprinkling of grated cheese. </li>
    <li>Alternatively, combine the garlic, salt, and pine nuts in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the nuts are finely chopped. Add the basil leaves and the cheeses. While the machine is running, stream in the olive oil. </li>
    <li>Use immediately or store the pesto in an airtight container. Before closing the lid, add a thin layer of olive oil on top of the pesto to prevent discoloring. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.</li>
