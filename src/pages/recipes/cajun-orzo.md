## Ingredients

* 1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 small yellow onion, chopped
* 1 red bell pepper, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 12 oz. andouille sausage, sliced
* 8 oz. orzo
* 1 (14-oz.) can fire roasted diced tomatoes
* 2 c. low-sodium chicken broth
* 2 Tbsp. cajun seasoning
* Kosher salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 4 oz. cream cheese, cut into cubes

## Instructions

1. In a large deep skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and pepper and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add sausage and cook until warmed through and golden, about 2 minutes. 
2. Add orzo and stir to toast for 1 minute. Add diced tomatoes, broth, and cajun seasoning. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until orzo is cooked through and tender, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
3. Add cream cheese and stir until melted, then stir in green onions.
