<ol class='list-decimal ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>Saute onion in butter until softened, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add mushrooms, salt, and pepper. Cook until mushrooms have released juices. Add garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add the wine to deglaze and loosen any bits off the pan and simmer a few minutes until the wine has almost evaporated.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken broth and cream. Simmer 5 minutes or until reduced by half.</li>
    <li>To thicken the sauce further, combine cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water (or broth) and mix well. Add cornstarch mixture into the broth a little bit at a time to reach desired consistency. You may not need all of the cornstarch mixture.</li>
