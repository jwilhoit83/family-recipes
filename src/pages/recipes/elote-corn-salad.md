<h2 class='text-2xl py-4'>Ingredients</h2>
<ul class='list-disc ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>8 ears corn, husks removed</li>
    <li>1/2 cup diced red onion</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon cumin</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cilantro, chopped</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons chopped fresh chives</li>
    <li>1/2 cup crumbled Cotija cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2 class='text-2xl py-4'>Instructions</h2>
<ol class='list-decimal ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>Cook the corn on a grill or grill pan then use a sharp knife to slice off the kernels.</li>
    <li>Add the kernels and diced onion to a large bowl, and while it is still warm, stir in the butter, sour cream, lime juice, smoke paprika, cumin, cilantro, Cotija cheese, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Taste and season the salad with additional salt and pepper as desired. Serve immediately. </li>
</ol>
<h2 class='text-2xl py-4'>Notes</h2>
<ol class='list-decimal ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>Eight cups of canned corn or frozen corn that has been thawed works great in this recipe, too. It’s not necessary but if you’d like to char the corn kernels, heat a cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat, then add the corn and sauté 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until kernels are lightly charred.</li>
    <li>If you’re making this recipe ahead of time, you can mix everything together up to 1 day in advance and keep it covered in the fridge.</li>
    <li>Queso fresco, grated Parmesan cheese or crumbled feta can all be used in place of Cotija cheese.</li>
