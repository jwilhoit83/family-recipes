<h2 class='text-2xl py-4'>Ingredients</h2>
<ul class='list-disc ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>2 cups cherry tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>one 8-ounce block feta cheese, drained</li>
    <li>½ pound penne pasta, uncooked</li>
    <li>¼ cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
</ul>
<h2 class='text-2xl py-4'>Instructions</h2>
<ol class='list-decimal ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375F.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine olive oil, cherry tomatoes, garlic, salt, and pepper. Toss well to coat.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
    <li>Place a block of feta cheese in the centre of the casserole dish and bake until the tomatoes have burst and the feta has softened, about 30 minutes. Optionally, broil on high for 3-5 minutes until the cheese turns golden brown.</li>
    <li>While the cheese is baking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add pasta and cook until al dente (fully cooked but still firm) according to package directions, about 10 minutes. Reserve ½ cup pasta water and drain.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked and drained pasta to the casserole dish and toss well to coat. Slowly stir in some pasta water if needed (if the cheese sauce is too thick).</li>
    <li>Stir in basil and serve warm.</li>
