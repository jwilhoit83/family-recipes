<h2 class='text-2xl py-4'>Ingredients</h2>
<ul class='list-disc ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>1/2 cup finely diced onion</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper diced</li>
    <li>1 cup uncooked parboiled long-grain brown rice (can also use long grain white rice)</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons fajita seasoning (homemade or store-bought)</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
    <li>1 cup corn kernels frozen</li>
    <li>1 14 ounce can low sodium black beans drained and rinsed</li>
    <li>5 cups shredded chicken</li>
    <li>3 cups reduced sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 4 ounce can mild green chilies</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2 class='text-2xl py-4'>Instructions</h2>
<ol class='list-decimal ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Add onion, bell pepper, uncooked rice, fajita seasoning and cayenne (if using) to a 9x13 inch baking dish and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the chicken broth, green chiles, tomato paste and olive oil until well combined.</li>
    <li>Add the broth mixture to the baking dish and stir to combine with the rice mixture.</li>
    <li>Add shredded chicken, black beans and corn to the baking dish. Give it an additional stir until well combined.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminium foil and then transfer to the oven to bake for 65-70 minutes or until all of the liquid is absorbed.</li>
    <li>Once complete, remove the baking dish from the oven, remove the aluminium foil, and sprinkle evenly with grated cheese.</li>
    <li>Return the baking dish to the oven for a final 5-10 minutes until the cheese has melted and is slightly golden.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven, allow to cool for 5-10 minutes, and serve with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro, green onion, salsa and avocado, if desired.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class='text-2xl py-4'>Notes</h2>
<ol class='list-decimal ms-4 ps-4 py-2'>
    <li>The amount of time this chicken burrito casserole requires will depend on your oven. I put mine in the oven for 70 minutes using parboiled long-grain brown rice, and an additional 5 minutes after the cheese was added.</li>
    <li>If your casserole is still a bit soupy when you check on it, it most likely needs more time in the oven. Give it a quick stir to redistribute the liquid and place in the oven until the majority of the liquid has been absorbed. Keep in mind that some of the extra liquid will absorb into the rice as it sits as well.</li>
    <li>I like to use my homemade fajita seasoning for this recipe, but you can also use store-bought or sub in taco seasoning instead.</li>
    <li>If you don’t have cooked shredded chicken, you can use a rotisserie chicken or boil chicken breasts on the stove and shred or bake in the oven for 25 minutes. Once cooked, place chicken on a cutting board and use two forks to shred the chicken into bite-size pieces.</li>
